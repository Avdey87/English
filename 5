Liz: What's The Restaurant? Have you seen it? 
Lin: Yes, it's a TV show for people who want to open a restaurant with Raymond Blanc. Nine teams start, but
most of them have to leave during the series as only one team can win.
Liz: What do they have to do? 
Lin: Well, each week all of the teams do a task in their restaurant, but only some of them can succeed. 
Liz: What do you mean? Do Do any of them have to leave the show? 
Lin: No, most of them have to leave at this point, but some of the teams - the worst two or three - do another 
task, and then the worst team has to leave.
Liz: Do the teams come from different restaurant or are they amateur cooks?
Lin: I don't think any of them are complete amateurs -they all have some professional experience.
