Chaper 1 

1. Which of the following is not a function of the Linux kernel?
C GUI programs create menus with the help of a library that’s designed for this
purpose; this is not a function of the Linux kernel. Thus option C is a
nonkernel function, and it is correct. The kernel allocates memory and CPU
time, and it also controls access to disk and network hardware, so options A, B,
D, and E all describe kernel functions and are incorrect.

2. Which of the following is an example of an embedded Linux OS?
  A Android is used on smartphones, tablet computers, and other small portable
devices. As such, it qualifies as an embedded OS, making option A correct.
SUSE, CentOS, Debian, and Fedora are all examples of distributions intended
mainly for use on desktop, laptop, and server computers; these do not qualify
as embedded OSs, so options B, C, D, and E are all incorrect.

3. Which of the following is a notable difference between Linux and Mac OS X?
  B Linux’s GUI is based on the X Window System. Although OS X provides an
X implementation, its primary GUI is Apple’s proprietary product. Thus option
B is correct. Option A is incorrect because both Linux and OS X can run most
GNU programs. Option C is incorrect because Linux can run on both Apple
Macintosh and commodity PC hardware. Option D is incorrect because OS X
includes many BSD utilities in its standard form. Furthermore, most Linux
distributions use GNU utilities rather than their BSD equivalents, although you
can use BSD utilities in Linux if you prefer. Option E is incorrect because both
Linux and OS X support text-mode commands, although OS X makes it hard to
use these commands in anything but its GUI Terminal application.

4. True or false: The Linux kernel is derived from the BSD kernel.
  False The Linux kernel was intended as a “from-scratch” project to create a
new Unix-like kernel. Although there are influences and similarities, the two
kernels are largely independent of each other.

5. True or false: If you log in to a Linux system in graphical mode, you cannot use text-mode commands in that session.
  False Programs known as terminals enable entry of text-mode commands
after you’ve logged into Linux in GUI mode. You can also switch between
multiple virtual terminals by using keystrokes such as Ctrl+Alt+F2.

6. True or false: CentOS is a Linux distribution with a long release cycle.
  True CentOS’s release cycle is approximately every two years, which is long by
the standards of Linux distributions, some of which have release cycles of just
6 months.
7. A Linux text-mode login prompt reads ___________ (one word).
  login:

8. A common security problem with Windows that’s essentially nonexistent on Linux is ___________.
  viruses
  
9. Prerelease software that’s likely to contain bugs is known as ___________ and ___________.
  alpha and beta
10. Linux distributions that have no version number but instead releaseupgrades in an ongoing manner are said to have a(n) ___________ release cycle.
  rolling
  
 Chapter 2 
 
 1. Which of the following is not required in order for software to be certified
as open source?
C The open source definition specifies that users should be able to distribute
changes, but it doesn’t require that users distribute the software under the
terms of the same license. Thus option C does not describe an open source
requirement, and so it is the correct answer. Options A, B, D, and E all
paraphrase actual open source license term requirements.

2. Which is true of Linux distributions as a whole?
B Some distributions (particularly Enterprise versions that are sold for money)
include software that is neither open source nor even freely redistributable, so
option B is correct. Distributions as a whole use many licenses, not just one, so
option A is incorrect. The MIT license is one of several open source licenses;
such software is not an impediment to copying a distribution, so option C is
incorrect. Although some distributions, such as Debian, aim to make their
main systems fully open source compliant, not all do this, so option D is
incorrect. Likewise, not all distributions are composed completely of free
software as the FSF uses the term.

3. Which of the following is a key part of the FSF’s philosophy?
E Option E paraphrases one of the four key points in the FSF’s philosophy, and
so it is correct. Contrary to option A, the FSF’s philosophy does not mandate
the use of the GPL, much less its most recent version, although the GPL is the
FSF’s preferred license. Option B is contrary to the FSF’s position, which is
that free software should remain free; however, this option is compatible with
the OSI’s philosophy. Although the FSF advocates free software and free OSs,
option C is not an explicit part of their philosophy and so is incorrect. Although
the FSF wants to see a world dominated by free software, they do not advocate
software piracy, so option D is incorrect.

4. True or false: Copyright law governs the distribution of software in most
countries.
True Courts and laws explicitly recognize computer software as being creative
works that are governed by copyright law. In some countries, patent laws also
apply to software, although this is not globally true.

5. True or false: The FSF’s free software definition and the OSI’s 10 principles
of open source software both require that users have the ability to examine
a program’s workings—that is, its source code.
True This principle is at the heart of both the free software and the open
source software definitions.

6. True or false: Because their hardware designs are proprietary, hardware
vendors cannot release open source drivers for their products.
False Hardware vendors often do release open source drivers for their
products. One caveat is that the release of open source drivers necessarily
render some programming interfaces for the hardware open, which some
hardware vendors are reluctant to do.

7. A license created by the FSF and often used for libraries is the___________.
LGPL (or Lesser GPL, or Lesser General Public License)

8. An organization devoted to promoting open source–like principles in fields
such as video and audio recordings is the ___________.
Creative Commons

9. The FSF’s general principles are summarized by the term ___________,
which refers to using copyright laws for purposes that are in some ways
contrary to copyright’s original intent.
copyleft

10. Users can motivate programmers to work on open source projects by
offering a(n) ___________ to whomever completes the project first.
bounty
