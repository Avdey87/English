Chaper 1 

1. Which of the following is not a function of the Linux kernel?
C GUI programs create menus with the help of a library that’s designed for this
purpose; this is not a function of the Linux kernel. Thus option C is a
nonkernel function, and it is correct. The kernel allocates memory and CPU
time, and it also controls access to disk and network hardware, so options A, B,
D, and E all describe kernel functions and are incorrect.

2. Which of the following is an example of an embedded Linux OS?
  A Android is used on smartphones, tablet computers, and other small portable
devices. As such, it qualifies as an embedded OS, making option A correct.
SUSE, CentOS, Debian, and Fedora are all examples of distributions intended
mainly for use on desktop, laptop, and server computers; these do not qualify
as embedded OSs, so options B, C, D, and E are all incorrect.

3. Which of the following is a notable difference between Linux and Mac OS X?
  B Linux’s GUI is based on the X Window System. Although OS X provides an
X implementation, its primary GUI is Apple’s proprietary product. Thus option
B is correct. Option A is incorrect because both Linux and OS X can run most
GNU programs. Option C is incorrect because Linux can run on both Apple
Macintosh and commodity PC hardware. Option D is incorrect because OS X
includes many BSD utilities in its standard form. Furthermore, most Linux
distributions use GNU utilities rather than their BSD equivalents, although you
can use BSD utilities in Linux if you prefer. Option E is incorrect because both
Linux and OS X support text-mode commands, although OS X makes it hard to
use these commands in anything but its GUI Terminal application.

4. True or false: The Linux kernel is derived from the BSD kernel.
  False The Linux kernel was intended as a “from-scratch” project to create a
new Unix-like kernel. Although there are influences and similarities, the two
kernels are largely independent of each other.

5. True or false: If you log in to a Linux system in graphical mode, you cannot use text-mode commands in that session.
  False Programs known as terminals enable entry of text-mode commands
after you’ve logged into Linux in GUI mode. You can also switch between
multiple virtual terminals by using keystrokes such as Ctrl+Alt+F2.

6. True or false: CentOS is a Linux distribution with a long release cycle.
  True CentOS’s release cycle is approximately every two years, which is long by
the standards of Linux distributions, some of which have release cycles of just
6 months.
7. A Linux text-mode login prompt reads ___________ (one word).
  login:

8. A common security problem with Windows that’s essentially nonexistent on Linux is ___________.
  viruses
  
9. Prerelease software that’s likely to contain bugs is known as ___________ and ___________.
  alpha and beta
10. Linux distributions that have no version number but instead releaseupgrades in an ongoing manner are said to have a(n) ___________ release cycle.
  rolling
  
 Chapter 2 
 
 1. Which of the following is not required in order for software to be certified
as open source?
C The open source definition specifies that users should be able to distribute
changes, but it doesn’t require that users distribute the software under the
terms of the same license. Thus option C does not describe an open source
requirement, and so it is the correct answer. Options A, B, D, and E all
paraphrase actual open source license term requirements.

2. Which is true of Linux distributions as a whole?
B Some distributions (particularly Enterprise versions that are sold for money)
include software that is neither open source nor even freely redistributable, so
option B is correct. Distributions as a whole use many licenses, not just one, so
option A is incorrect. The MIT license is one of several open source licenses;
such software is not an impediment to copying a distribution, so option C is
incorrect. Although some distributions, such as Debian, aim to make their
main systems fully open source compliant, not all do this, so option D is
incorrect. Likewise, not all distributions are composed completely of free
software as the FSF uses the term.

3. Which of the following is a key part of the FSF’s philosophy?
E Option E paraphrases one of the four key points in the FSF’s philosophy, and
so it is correct. Contrary to option A, the FSF’s philosophy does not mandate
the use of the GPL, much less its most recent version, although the GPL is the
FSF’s preferred license. Option B is contrary to the FSF’s position, which is
that free software should remain free; however, this option is compatible with
the OSI’s philosophy. Although the FSF advocates free software and free OSs,
option C is not an explicit part of their philosophy and so is incorrect. Although
the FSF wants to see a world dominated by free software, they do not advocate
software piracy, so option D is incorrect.

4. True or false: Copyright law governs the distribution of software in most
countries.
True Courts and laws explicitly recognize computer software as being creative
works that are governed by copyright law. In some countries, patent laws also
apply to software, although this is not globally true.

5. True or false: The FSF’s free software definition and the OSI’s 10 principles
of open source software both require that users have the ability to examine
a program’s workings—that is, its source code.
True This principle is at the heart of both the free software and the open
source software definitions.

6. True or false: Because their hardware designs are proprietary, hardware
vendors cannot release open source drivers for their products.
False Hardware vendors often do release open source drivers for their
products. One caveat is that the release of open source drivers necessarily
render some programming interfaces for the hardware open, which some
hardware vendors are reluctant to do.

7. A license created by the FSF and often used for libraries is the___________.
LGPL (or Lesser GPL, or Lesser General Public License)

8. An organization devoted to promoting open source–like principles in fields
such as video and audio recordings is the ___________.
Creative Commons

9. The FSF’s general principles are summarized by the term ___________,
which refers to using copyright laws for purposes that are in some ways
contrary to copyright’s original intent.
copyleft

10. Users can motivate programmers to work on open source projects by
offering a(n) ___________ to whomever completes the project first.
bounty

CHAPTER 3

1. What type of multitasking does Linux use?
  A Linux’s multitasking is preemptive, meaning that the kernel can give CPU
time to any process as it sees fit, potentially interrupting (or preempting) other
processes. Thus option A is correct. Linux is a multiuser OS, but multiuser is
not a type of multitasking, so option B is incorrect. In a cooperative
multitasking OS, applications must voluntarily give up CPU time to each other.
Although Linux programs can signal the OS that they don’t need CPU time,
Linux doesn’t rely exclusively on this method, so option C is incorrect. A
single-tasking OS can run just one process at a time, so option D is incorrect. A
single-user OS can support just one user at a time. Such OSs can be either
single tasking or multitasking, and in the latter case, could use either
cooperative or preemptive multitasking. Thus option E is incorrect.

2. Which of the following is a characteristic of all open source software?
  C The open source definition includes 10 points, one of which is that users may
modify the original code and redistribute the altered version. Thus option C is
correct. Although, as a practical matter, all open source software is available at
no charge, nothing in the open source definition forbids selling it. In practice,
many organizations and individuals do sell open source software, either as a
convenience (such as DVD-ROMs with Linux distributions for those with slow
Internet connections) or in value-added arrangements (such as Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, which bundles open source software with a support
contract). Thus option A is incorrect. The open source definition requires
distribution of source code, but does not require distribution of binaries. Thus
option B is incorrect. Although some open source software, including the Linux
kernel, began life in academia, this is not true of all open source software, so
option D is incorrect. The open source definition does not specify that either an
interpreted or a compiled language be used, and in fact both have been used to
write open source software, so option E is incorrect.

3. Which of the following programs is most likely to be installed and
regularly used on a desktop computer that runs Linux?
  D Evolution is an email reader program. Such programs are common on
desktop computers, so option D is correct. Apache is a web server, Postfix is an
email server, and the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is a Domain
Name System (DNS) server. Such servers are much less likely to be installed on
desktop computers than are client programs such as Evolution, so options A,
B, and E are all incorrect. Android is the name of a Linux distribution for
smartphones and tablets, so option C is incorrect.

4. True or false: VMS was a common OS on x86 PCs at the time Linux was
created.
  False VMS was an OS for minicomputers and mainframes when Linux was
created. On x86 computers, DOS was the dominant OS in 1991.

5. True or false: Some DVRs run Linux.
  True Digital video recorders (DVRs) are specialized computers for recording
TV shows. Some commercial DVRs, such as TiVos, run Linux natively. DVR
software for standard PCs, such as MythTV, which runs under Linux, also
exists.

6. True or false: A Linux computer being used as a server generally does not
require X.
  True Most server programs do not require the X Window System (X) GUI, so
server computer administrators often disable X or even remove it entirely to
save disk space and memory and to minimize the risk of security problems.

7. Linux uses a(n) ___________ kernel design, as contrasted with a
microkernel design.
  monolithic

8. A type of software that's distributed for free but that requires payment on
the honor system if a person uses it is called ___________.
  shareware

9. A(n) ___________ computer is likely to run a word processor and web
browser.
  desktop

10. The ___________ software package is an example of a web server
written for the Linux server environment.
  Apache
  
CHAPTER 4 

1. Which of the following are Linux desktop environments? (Select all that
apply.)
  B, C, E GNOME, KDE, and Xfce are all Linux desktop environments, so
options B, C, and E are all correct. (Others include LXDE and Unity.) The
GIMP Toolkit (GTK+) is a GUI programming library. Although GNOME and
Xfce are both built atop GTK+, it’s not a desktop environment, so option A is
incorrect. Evolution is a Linux email client, not a desktop environment, so
option D is incorrect.

2. If you want to enable one Linux computer to access files stored on another
Linux computer’s hard disk, which of the following network protocols is
the best choice?
  B The Network File System (NFS) was designed for exactly the task described
in the question, so option B is correct. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP) enables one computer to send email messages to another computer, so
it’s a poor choice for achieving the stated goal and option A is incorrect. The
PHP: Hypertext Processor (PHP) language is used to generate dynamic
content for web pages, so option C is incorrect. The Domain Name System
(DNS) is a protocol for delivering the mappings between hostnames and IP
addresses to computers, so it won’t easily achieve the stated goals, making
option D incorrect. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) enables
one computer to provide network configuration information to another one
over a network link, so option E is incorrect.

3. In which of the following languages was most of the Linux kernel written?
  C The main language for the Linux kernel is C, so option C is correct. Although
Bash shell scripts control much of the Linux startup process, these scripts are
not part of the kernel, so option A is incorrect. Java is a popular language for
web-based applications, but it’s not used in the Linux kernel, so option B is
incorrect. C++ is a derivative of C that adds object-oriented features to the
language, but the Linux kernel uses regular C, not C++, so option D is
incorrect. Perl is a popular interpreted language, particularly for tasks that
involve processing text, but it’s not the language of the Linux kernel, so option
E is incorrect.

4. True or false: OpenOffice.org forked from Calligra.
  False LibreOffice forked from the pre-Apache version of OpenOffice.org in
2011. Calligra split from the KOffice office suite, which is no longer
maintained.

5. True or false: Malicious outsiders can disrupt servers even if the computer
that runs them is never broken into.
  True A denial-of-service (DoS) attack can disrupt a server’s operation by
directing an overwhelming quantity of bogus data at the server program, or
even just the computer on which it runs. This is true even if the server is
impeccably managed.

6. True or false: Python is generally implemented as an interpreted language.
  True Python, like Perl, PHP, and shell languages, is interpreted. This contrasts
with C and C++, which are two common compiled languages, and with Java,
which is somewhere in-between

7. Thunderbird is a(n) program. (Specify the general category of the
software.)
  email client

8. A Linux server that handles the SMB/CIFS protocol normally runs the
software.
  Samba

9. A program written in a(n) programming language is completely converted
to binary form before being run.
  compiled

10. You can install and manage various Linux software applications via a(n)
management system.
  Package
