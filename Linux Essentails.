Chaper 1 

1. Which of the following is not a function of the Linux kernel?
C GUI programs create menus with the help of a library that’s designed for this
purpose; this is not a function of the Linux kernel. Thus option C is a
nonkernel function, and it is correct. The kernel allocates memory and CPU
time, and it also controls access to disk and network hardware, so options A, B,
D, and E all describe kernel functions and are incorrect.

2. Which of the following is an example of an embedded Linux OS?
  A Android is used on smartphones, tablet computers, and other small portable
devices. As such, it qualifies as an embedded OS, making option A correct.
SUSE, CentOS, Debian, and Fedora are all examples of distributions intended
mainly for use on desktop, laptop, and server computers; these do not qualify
as embedded OSs, so options B, C, D, and E are all incorrect.

3. Which of the following is a notable difference between Linux and Mac OS X?
  B Linux’s GUI is based on the X Window System. Although OS X provides an
X implementation, its primary GUI is Apple’s proprietary product. Thus option
B is correct. Option A is incorrect because both Linux and OS X can run most
GNU programs. Option C is incorrect because Linux can run on both Apple
Macintosh and commodity PC hardware. Option D is incorrect because OS X
includes many BSD utilities in its standard form. Furthermore, most Linux
distributions use GNU utilities rather than their BSD equivalents, although you
can use BSD utilities in Linux if you prefer. Option E is incorrect because both
Linux and OS X support text-mode commands, although OS X makes it hard to
use these commands in anything but its GUI Terminal application.

4. True or false: The Linux kernel is derived from the BSD kernel.
  False The Linux kernel was intended as a “from-scratch” project to create a
new Unix-like kernel. Although there are influences and similarities, the two
kernels are largely independent of each other.

5. True or false: If you log in to a Linux system in graphical mode, you cannot use text-mode commands in that session.
  False Programs known as terminals enable entry of text-mode commands
after you’ve logged into Linux in GUI mode. You can also switch between
multiple virtual terminals by using keystrokes such as Ctrl+Alt+F2.

6. True or false: CentOS is a Linux distribution with a long release cycle.
  True CentOS’s release cycle is approximately every two years, which is long by
the standards of Linux distributions, some of which have release cycles of just
6 months.
7. A Linux text-mode login prompt reads ___________ (one word).
  login:

8. A common security problem with Windows that’s essentially nonexistent on Linux is ___________.
  viruses
  
9. Prerelease software that’s likely to contain bugs is known as ___________ and ___________.
  alpha and beta
10. Linux distributions that have no version number but instead releaseupgrades in an ongoing manner are said to have a(n) ___________ release cycle.
  rolling
  
 Chapter 2 
 
 1. Which of the following is not required in order for software to be certified
as open source?
C The open source definition specifies that users should be able to distribute
changes, but it doesn’t require that users distribute the software under the
terms of the same license. Thus option C does not describe an open source
requirement, and so it is the correct answer. Options A, B, D, and E all
paraphrase actual open source license term requirements.

2. Which is true of Linux distributions as a whole?
B Some distributions (particularly Enterprise versions that are sold for money)
include software that is neither open source nor even freely redistributable, so
option B is correct. Distributions as a whole use many licenses, not just one, so
option A is incorrect. The MIT license is one of several open source licenses;
such software is not an impediment to copying a distribution, so option C is
incorrect. Although some distributions, such as Debian, aim to make their
main systems fully open source compliant, not all do this, so option D is
incorrect. Likewise, not all distributions are composed completely of free
software as the FSF uses the term.

3. Which of the following is a key part of the FSF’s philosophy?
E Option E paraphrases one of the four key points in the FSF’s philosophy, and
so it is correct. Contrary to option A, the FSF’s philosophy does not mandate
the use of the GPL, much less its most recent version, although the GPL is the
FSF’s preferred license. Option B is contrary to the FSF’s position, which is
that free software should remain free; however, this option is compatible with
the OSI’s philosophy. Although the FSF advocates free software and free OSs,
option C is not an explicit part of their philosophy and so is incorrect. Although
the FSF wants to see a world dominated by free software, they do not advocate
software piracy, so option D is incorrect.

4. True or false: Copyright law governs the distribution of software in most
countries.
True Courts and laws explicitly recognize computer software as being creative
works that are governed by copyright law. In some countries, patent laws also
apply to software, although this is not globally true.

5. True or false: The FSF’s free software definition and the OSI’s 10 principles
of open source software both require that users have the ability to examine
a program’s workings—that is, its source code.
True This principle is at the heart of both the free software and the open
source software definitions.

6. True or false: Because their hardware designs are proprietary, hardware
vendors cannot release open source drivers for their products.
False Hardware vendors often do release open source drivers for their
products. One caveat is that the release of open source drivers necessarily
render some programming interfaces for the hardware open, which some
hardware vendors are reluctant to do.

7. A license created by the FSF and often used for libraries is the___________.
LGPL (or Lesser GPL, or Lesser General Public License)

8. An organization devoted to promoting open source–like principles in fields
such as video and audio recordings is the ___________.
Creative Commons

9. The FSF’s general principles are summarized by the term ___________,
which refers to using copyright laws for purposes that are in some ways
contrary to copyright’s original intent.
copyleft

10. Users can motivate programmers to work on open source projects by
offering a(n) ___________ to whomever completes the project first.
bounty

CHAPTER 3

1. What type of multitasking does Linux use?
  A Linux’s multitasking is preemptive, meaning that the kernel can give CPU
time to any process as it sees fit, potentially interrupting (or preempting) other
processes. Thus option A is correct. Linux is a multiuser OS, but multiuser is
not a type of multitasking, so option B is incorrect. In a cooperative
multitasking OS, applications must voluntarily give up CPU time to each other.
Although Linux programs can signal the OS that they don’t need CPU time,
Linux doesn’t rely exclusively on this method, so option C is incorrect. A
single-tasking OS can run just one process at a time, so option D is incorrect. A
single-user OS can support just one user at a time. Such OSs can be either
single tasking or multitasking, and in the latter case, could use either
cooperative or preemptive multitasking. Thus option E is incorrect.

2. Which of the following is a characteristic of all open source software?
  C The open source definition includes 10 points, one of which is that users may
modify the original code and redistribute the altered version. Thus option C is
correct. Although, as a practical matter, all open source software is available at
no charge, nothing in the open source definition forbids selling it. In practice,
many organizations and individuals do sell open source software, either as a
convenience (such as DVD-ROMs with Linux distributions for those with slow
Internet connections) or in value-added arrangements (such as Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, which bundles open source software with a support
contract). Thus option A is incorrect. The open source definition requires
distribution of source code, but does not require distribution of binaries. Thus
option B is incorrect. Although some open source software, including the Linux
kernel, began life in academia, this is not true of all open source software, so
option D is incorrect. The open source definition does not specify that either an
interpreted or a compiled language be used, and in fact both have been used to
write open source software, so option E is incorrect.

3. Which of the following programs is most likely to be installed and
regularly used on a desktop computer that runs Linux?
  D Evolution is an email reader program. Such programs are common on
desktop computers, so option D is correct. Apache is a web server, Postfix is an
email server, and the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is a Domain
Name System (DNS) server. Such servers are much less likely to be installed on
desktop computers than are client programs such as Evolution, so options A,
B, and E are all incorrect. Android is the name of a Linux distribution for
smartphones and tablets, so option C is incorrect.

4. True or false: VMS was a common OS on x86 PCs at the time Linux was
created.
  False VMS was an OS for minicomputers and mainframes when Linux was
created. On x86 computers, DOS was the dominant OS in 1991.

5. True or false: Some DVRs run Linux.
  True Digital video recorders (DVRs) are specialized computers for recording
TV shows. Some commercial DVRs, such as TiVos, run Linux natively. DVR
software for standard PCs, such as MythTV, which runs under Linux, also
exists.

6. True or false: A Linux computer being used as a server generally does not
require X.
  True Most server programs do not require the X Window System (X) GUI, so
server computer administrators often disable X or even remove it entirely to
save disk space and memory and to minimize the risk of security problems.

7. Linux uses a(n) ___________ kernel design, as contrasted with a
microkernel design.
  monolithic

8. A type of software that's distributed for free but that requires payment on
the honor system if a person uses it is called ___________.
  shareware

9. A(n) ___________ computer is likely to run a word processor and web
browser.
  desktop

10. The ___________ software package is an example of a web server
written for the Linux server environment.
  Apache
  
CHAPTER 4 

1. Which of the following are Linux desktop environments? (Select all that
apply.)
  B, C, E GNOME, KDE, and Xfce are all Linux desktop environments, so
options B, C, and E are all correct. (Others include LXDE and Unity.) The
GIMP Toolkit (GTK+) is a GUI programming library. Although GNOME and
Xfce are both built atop GTK+, it’s not a desktop environment, so option A is
incorrect. Evolution is a Linux email client, not a desktop environment, so
option D is incorrect.

2. If you want to enable one Linux computer to access files stored on another
Linux computer’s hard disk, which of the following network protocols is
the best choice?
  B The Network File System (NFS) was designed for exactly the task described
in the question, so option B is correct. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP) enables one computer to send email messages to another computer, so
it’s a poor choice for achieving the stated goal and option A is incorrect. The
PHP: Hypertext Processor (PHP) language is used to generate dynamic
content for web pages, so option C is incorrect. The Domain Name System
(DNS) is a protocol for delivering the mappings between hostnames and IP
addresses to computers, so it won’t easily achieve the stated goals, making
option D incorrect. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) enables
one computer to provide network configuration information to another one
over a network link, so option E is incorrect.

3. In which of the following languages was most of the Linux kernel written?
  C The main language for the Linux kernel is C, so option C is correct. Although
Bash shell scripts control much of the Linux startup process, these scripts are
not part of the kernel, so option A is incorrect. Java is a popular language for
web-based applications, but it’s not used in the Linux kernel, so option B is
incorrect. C++ is a derivative of C that adds object-oriented features to the
language, but the Linux kernel uses regular C, not C++, so option D is
incorrect. Perl is a popular interpreted language, particularly for tasks that
involve processing text, but it’s not the language of the Linux kernel, so option
E is incorrect.

4. True or false: OpenOffice.org forked from Calligra.
  False LibreOffice forked from the pre-Apache version of OpenOffice.org in
2011. Calligra split from the KOffice office suite, which is no longer
maintained.

5. True or false: Malicious outsiders can disrupt servers even if the computer
that runs them is never broken into.
  True A denial-of-service (DoS) attack can disrupt a server’s operation by
directing an overwhelming quantity of bogus data at the server program, or
even just the computer on which it runs. This is true even if the server is
impeccably managed.

6. True or false: Python is generally implemented as an interpreted language.
  True Python, like Perl, PHP, and shell languages, is interpreted. This contrasts
with C and C++, which are two common compiled languages, and with Java,
which is somewhere in-between

7. Thunderbird is a(n) program. (Specify the general category of the
software.)
  email client

8. A Linux server that handles the SMB/CIFS protocol normally runs the
software.
  Samba

9. A program written in a(n) programming language is completely converted
to binary form before being run.
  compiled

10. You can install and manage various Linux software applications via a(n)
management system.
  Package


CHAPTER 5

1. Which of the following commands provides the most information about
your motherboard’s features?
  D The lspci command displays information on PCI devices. Since many
motherboard features appear to Linux as PCI devices, option D provides a
great deal of information on your motherboard, and so it is correct. Option A’s
lscpu command provides information on the CPU, which means that it
provides little direct information on the motherboard, so option A is incorrect.
The Xorg program is the Linux X server, and option B creates a new X
configuration file. This file might provide hints about video hardware on the
motherboard, but option D provides better and more information, so option B
is incorrect. The fdisk utility can partition a disk, and the command in option
C displays information on how /dev/sda is partitioned. This information has
nothing to do with the motherboard’s features, though, so option C is
incorrect. You can enter http://localhost:631 in a web browser to configure
your printer, but even if you do this, you’ll gain no information about your
motherboard’s features, so option E is incorrect.

2. Why might you want to partition a hard disk? (Select all that apply.)
  A, D Disk partitioning enables you to separate data of different types into
different parts of a disk. Examples of reasons to do this include installing
multiple OSs and separating filesystem data from swap space. Thus options A
and D are both correct. Filesystem choice (ext4fs vs. ReiserFS) has nothing to
do with partitioning, unless you want to use one filesystem for one partition
and the other on another partition, so option B is incorrect. The Parallel
Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA) and Serial ATA (SATA) interfaces
are hardware standards; you can’t turn a PATA disk into an SATA disk by
partitioning the disk, so option C is incorrect. Hard disks have caches to
improve performance, but partitioning the disk does not separate the disk’s
cache from the bulk of the disk’s data, so option E is incorrect

3. Which of the following devices is not commonly attached via USB?
  A Video monitors normally attach to the video circuitry built into a computer’s
motherboard or to a separate video card, so option A is correct. Keyboards,
external hard disks, printers, and scanners all commonly connect to a
computer via USB, although alternative interfaces exist for all of these devices.

4. True or false: An Intel 64 CPU is capable of running a Linux distribution
identified as being for the AMD64 CPU.
  True Most CPU families have multiple names. EM64T is one name that Intel
has used for its implementation of the x86-64 architecture, and AMD64 is one
of AMD’s names for the same architecture. Thus the two names identify the
same architecture, and an AMD64 Linux distribution will run on an EM64T
CPU.

5. True or false: UDF is a good filesystem to use for a Linux installation on a
hard disk.
  False The Universal Disk Format (UDF) is a filesystem that’s used primarily
on optical discs, not on hard disks. Using it for a Linux installation on a hard
disk would be awkward or impossible. Linux-specific filesystems (ext2fs,
ext3fs, ext4fs, ReiserFS, JFS, XFS, and Btrfs) are the only practical choices for
Linux installations on a hard disk.

6. True or false: The Linux kernel includes drivers for various disk
controllers, network adapters, and USB interfaces, among other things.
  True In Linux, most drivers, including those specified, are provided as part of
the kernel. Some other drivers, such as those for video cards under X, printers,
and scanners, exist outside the kernel, although these may also rely on kernel
drivers to do their work.

7. The x86 CPU uses a(n) __-bit architecture.
  32

8. A computer power supply converts electricity from alternating current to __________________.
  direct current

9. The _________ standard is a modern video interface that’s commonly
used on computer monitors.
  Digital Visual Interface (DVI)

10. A piece of software that “talks” to hardware is known as a(n) _________.
  driver
  
CHAPTER 6 

1. What keystroke moves the cursor to the start of the line when typing a
command in Bash?
  A The Ctrl+A keystroke moves the cursor to the start of the line when editing a
command in Bash, so option A is correct. The left-arrow key moves a single
character to the left, Ctrl+T transposes two characters, the up arrow moves up
one item in the history, and Ctrl+E moves to the end of the line.

2. How can you run a program in the background when launching it from a
shell? (Select all that apply.)
  C, D Options C and D describe ways to run a program in the background from
a shell, so options C and D are both correct. Neither start nor bg is a command
that launches a program in the background. The fg command returns a
program to the foreground, meaning that the shell will go back to sleep, which
isn’t what the question specifies.

3. Which of the following commands is an improved version of more?
  D The less program, like more, displays a text file a page at a time. The less
utility also includes the ability to page backward in the text file, search its
contents, and do other things that more can’t do. Thus option D is correct. The
grep command searches a file for a specified string, so it doesn’t do a task that’s
similar to more, and option A is incorrect. The Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML) is a file format, often indicated with the filename extension .html,
that’s commonly used on the Web. As such, it’s not a better version of more, so
option B is incorrect. The cat command can concatenate two or more files, or
display a single file on the screen. In the former capacity, cat doesn’t do the
task of more, and in the latter capacity, cat is less capable than more. Thus
option C is incorrect. The man command displays Linux manual pages.
Although man uses less by default, man is not itself an improved version of
more, so option E is incorrect.

4. True or false: Pressing Alt+F2 in the GUI brings up a text-mode display
that you can use to log in to Linux.
  False When in X, Ctrl must be added to the VT-switching keystroke, so the
correct keystroke should be Ctrl+Alt+F2 (or other function keys, through F6).

5. True or false: You can force man to display a man page in a specific section of
the manual by preceding the search name with the section number, as in
man 5 passwd.
  True When you want to override man’s search order, you specify the desired
manual section between man and the command name, filename, or other name
on which you’re searching.

6. True or false: info pages are a web-based documentation format.
  False Although info pages, like web pages, use hyperlinks to tie related
documents together, the two systems use different formats and protocols. info
pages also reside on the computer’s hard disk; they require no Internet access
to read. For these reasons, info pages are not web-based.

7. True or false: Linux documentation in the /usr/share/doc directory tree is
almost always in OpenDocument text format.
  False Individual program authors decide on a documentation file format
based on their own specific needs and preferences. Although some documents
are in OpenDocument Text format, many documents are not.

8. Type logout or ______________ to end a text-mode terminal session.
  exit

9. Each document in an info page is known as a(n) ______________.
  node

10. The ______________ command searches a database of filenames,
enabling you to identify files quickly whose names match a term that you
specify.
  locate
  
CHAPTER 7 

1. Which of the following commands would you type to rename newfile.txt
to afile.txt?
  A The mv command moves or renames a file, so option A is correct. The cp
command copies a file, so option B is incorrect. The ln command creates a link
between two files, so option C is incorrect. Option D’s rn command is fictitious,
so this option is incorrect. The touch command creates a new file or adjusts the
time stamps on an existing file, so option E is incorrect.

2. You want to copy a directory, MyFiles, to a USB flash drive that uses the
FAT filesystem. The contents of MyFiles are as follows:

  The USB flash drive is mounted at /media/usb, and so you type cp -a
  MyFiles/ /media/usb. What problem will occur when you attempt to copy
  
  C Because two files (outline.pdf and Outline.PDF) have names that differ only
in case, and because FAT is a case-insensitive filesystem, one of those files will
be missing on the copy. (Both files will be copied, but the second one copied
will overwrite the first.) Thus option C is correct. The specified cp command
does not create links, so option A is incorrect. Because the specified cp
command included the -a option, which performs a recursive copy, all of the
files in MyFiles will be copied, along with the directory itself, so option B is
incorrect. In order to copy all of the files, you will have to change one file’s
name manually; however, cp won’t do this automatically, so option D is
incorrect. Because option C is correct, option E is not correct.

3. You type mkdir one/two/three and receive an error message that reads, in
part, No such file or directory. What can you do to overcome this
problem? (Select all that apply.)

A, B If you try to create a directory inside a directory that doesn’t exist, mkdir
responds with a No such file or directory error. The –parents parameter
tells mkdir to create all necessary parent directories automatically in such
situations, so option A is correct. You can also manually do this by creating
each necessary directory separately, so option B is also correct. (It’s possible
that mkdir one wouldn’t be necessary in this example if the directory one
already existed. No harm will come from trying to create a directory that
already exists, although mkdir will return a File exists error.) Option C will
have no useful effect; at most, it will change the time stamps on the mkdir
program file, but if you type it as a normal user, it probably won’t even do that.
Options D and E are both based on the premise that you must remove
directories that already exist with the names that you want to use, but this isn’t
true, so these options are both incorrect.

4. True or false: You can create a symbolic link from one low-level filesystem
to another.

True Symbolic links work by storing the name of the linked-to file in the
symbolic link file. Linux reads this filename and transparently substitutes the
linked-to file. This process works both on a single filesystem and across
filesystems, so the statement is true. Hard links, by contrast, work by providing
multiple directory entries that point to a single file. This method of creating a
link does not work across low-level filesystems.

5. True or false: You can easily damage your Linux installation by mistyping
an rm command when you log into your regular account.

  False Linux’s security features prevent accidental damage when you work as
an ordinary user. You must be more careful when you acquire root privileges
to perform system maintenance, though.

6. True or false: You can set a directory’s time stamps with the touch
command.
  True The touch command updates a file’s time stamps, and for this purpose, a
directory counts as a file, so this statement is true.

7. You want to copy a file (origfile.txt) to the backups directory, but if a file
called origfile.txt exists in the backups directory, you want to go ahead
with the copy only if the file in the source location is newer than the one in
backups. The command to do this is cp ____ origfile.txt backups/.
-u or —update

8. You’ve typed rmdir junk to delete the junk directory, but this command
has failed because junk contains word processing files. What command
might you type to do the job?

rm -R junk, rm -r junk, or rm --recursive junk

9. Which wildcard character matches any one symbol in a filename?
  ?

10. What directory primarily contains system configuration files?
  /etc
  
CHAPTER 8

1. Which of the following commands will print lines from the file world.txt
that contain matches to changes and changed?
   A	The	grep	utility	finds	matching	text	within	a	file	and	prints	those	lines.	It
accepts	regular	expressions,	which	means	that	you	can	place	in	brackets	the
two	characters	that	differ	in	the	words	for	which	you’re	looking.	Option	A
shows	the	correct	syntax	for	doing	this.	The	tar	utility	creates	or	manipulates
archive	files,	and	option	B’s	syntax	is	incorrect	for	any	use	of	tar,	so	that
option	is	incorrect.	The	find	utility	locates	files	based	on	filenames,	file	sizes,
and	other	surface	features.	Furthermore,	options	C	and	E	both	present
incorrect	syntax	for	find,	and	so	are	incorrect.	Option	D’s	cat	utility	displays	

2. Which of the following redirection operators appends a program’s
standard output to an existing file without overwriting that file’s original
contents?
   E	The	>>	operator	appends	standard	output	to	a	file,	so	option	E	is	correct.	The
vertical	bar	(|)	is	the	pipe	character;	it	ties	one	program’s	standard	output	to
another’s	standard	input,	so	option	A	is	incorrect.	The	2>	operator	redirects
standard	error,	not	standard	output,	and	it	overwrites	the	target	file.	Thus
option	B	is	incorrect.	The	&>	operator	redirects	both	standard	output	and
standard	error,	and	it	overwrites	the	target	file,	so	option	C	is	incorrect.	The	>
operator	redirects	standard	output,	but	it	overwrites	the	target	file,	so	option	D
is	incorrect.

3. You’ve received a tar archive called data79.tar from a colleague, but you
want to check the names of the files it contains before extracting them.
Which of the following commands would you use to do this?
   D	With	the	tar	utility,	the	—list	(t)	command	is	used	to	read	the	archive	and
display	its	contents.	The	—verbose	(v)	option	creates	a	verbose	file	listing,	and
—file	(f)	specifies	the	filename—data79.tar	in	this	case.	Option	D	uses	all	of
these	features,	and	therefore	does	as	the	question	specifies.	Options	A,	B,	C,
and	E	all	substitute	other	commands	for	—list,	which	is	required	by	the
question,	so	all	of	these	options	are	incorrect.


4. True or false: The regular expression Linu[^x].*lds matches the string
Linus Torvalds.
  True	The	special	characters	[^x]	match	any	single	character	except	x,	and	.*
matches	any	sequence	of	any	characters.	The	string	Linus	Torvalds	is	just	one
of	many	strings	to	match	the	specified	regular	expression.

5. True or false: The find command enables you to locate files based on their
sizes.
  True	You	can	use	the	-size	n	option	in	the	find	command	to	locate	files	based
on	their	sizes.

6. True or false: To compress files archived with zip, you must use an
external compression program such as gzip or bzip2 in a pipeline with zip.
  False	The	zip	utility	creates	or	manipulates	zip	archive	files.	This	file	type
supports	compression	directly,	as	does	the	zip	program.	Thus	there’s	no	need
to	involve	another	compression	program	to	compress	files	archived	with	zip.

7. The character that represents the start of a line in a regular expression is
_____________.
  ^

8. The _____________ command can extract specified data fields from a
file’s records.
  cut

9. Complete the following command to redirect both standard output and a
standard error from the bigprog program to the file out.txt.
$_____ bigprog out.txt  
 &>

10. The gzip, bzip2, and xz programs all perform _____________
compression, in which the uncompressed data exactly matches the original
precompression data.
  lossless
  
CHAPTER 9

1.	 Which	of	the	following	tools	is	best	suited	to	installing	a	software	package
and	all	of	its	dependencies	on	a	Debian	computer?
  E The apt-get utility is a network-enabled tool that can resolve dependencies
and retrieve all of the required packages to install a package that you specify.
Debian and its derivatives all use it, so option E is correct. The yum and zypper
programs are conceptually similar to apt-get, but they work on Red Hat (and
its derivatives) and SUSE distributions, respectively, so options A and B are
both incorrect. The dmesg program displays the kernel ring buffer; it has
nothing to do with package management, so option C is incorrect. The rpm
program is a non-network-enabled program for managing packages on an
RPM-based system, not on a Debian system, so option D is incorrect.

2.	 What	is	the	usual	name	of	the	first	process	that	the	Linux	kernel	runs,
aside	from	itself?
  A Typically, Linux starts init as the first process, so option A is correct. bash is
a Linux text-mode shell program. Although it’s important for user interaction,
it’s far from the first process Linux starts. The cron daemon manages timed
execution of programs to handle routine maintenance tasks. It’s started
automatically in the boot process, but it’s not the first process the kernel starts,
so option C is incorrect. Although the login process is critical to logging in
users in text mode, it’s started by init or by another process, so option D is
incorrect. The Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) boots the computer, so parts
of GRUB run before the kernel. Several Linux programs help manage a GRUB
installation, but the kernel doesn’t start any of them automatically. Thus
option E is incorrect.

3.	 Where	do	most	log	files	reside	on	a	Linux	computer?
  A Option A, /var/log, is the standard home for log files in Linux. Options B
through E all present fictitious locations and so are all incorrect.

4.	 True	or	false:	When	using	suitable	commands,	you	can	install	a	program
and	be	sure	that	all	of	the	software	on	which	it	depends	will	also	be
installed,	provided	you	have	an	Internet	connection.
  True Network-enabled package managers, such as APT, yum, zypper, and
urpmi, can automatically download and install dependent packages for a main
package.

5.	 True	or	false:	By	default,	the	first	process	listed	in	top	is	currently
consuming	the	most	CPU	time.
  True The top program sorts a process list by CPU use, so the topmost item in
the list is currently consuming the most CPU time. You can change the sort
order in various ways, though.

6.	 True	or	false:	The	dmesg	command	may	produce	different	output	after	a
computer	has	been	running	for	weeks	than	when	it	first	started.
  True Like on-disk log files, the kernel ring buffer (which dmesg displays)
changes as the computer runs. Thus its contents immediately after booting are
not likely to be the same as its contents after the computer has been running
for weeks.

7.	 Most	Linux	distributions	maintain	information	on	what	packages	are
installed	in	the	___________	___________.	(Two	words.)
  package database

8.	 You’re	using	bash,	and	you	type	emacs	to	launch	the	emacs	editor.	In	this
case,	emacs	is	bash’s	____________.
  child

9.	 General	system	messages	are	likely	to	be	found	in	/var/log/messages	or
/var/log/________________	,	depending	on	your	distribution.
  syslog

10.	 The	command	that	you	use	to	read	messages	generated	during	the	boot
process	and	stored	in	the	kernel	ring	buffer	is	the	_________	command.
  dmesg
  
CHAPTER 10 

1. For which type of file is nano least likely to be useful for examining or
editing?
  D LibreOffice, like most word processors, uses a binary format that can’t be
properly parsed using an ASCII or Unicode text editor. Thus nano won’t be
useful in examining such a document, making option D correct. The nano text
editor can handle ASCII or Unicode format, so the text files described in
options A and C are incorrect. The other document types described in options
B and E are all likely or certain to be stored in ASCII or Unicode format,
making them incorrect choices.

2. Which keystrokes invoke the pico or nano search function? (Select all that
apply.)
  B, E The F6 and Ctrl+W keystrokes both invoke the search function, so
options B and E are correct. The F3 key writes the current buffer to disk, so
option A is incorrect. The Esc+S keystroke is an obscure one; it enables or
disables smooth scrolling, so option C is incorrect. Ctrl+F moves forward one
character, so option D is incorrect.

3. How would you remove two lines of text from a file when using vi?
  A In the vi editor, dd is the command-mode command that deletes lines.
Preceding this command by a number deletes that number of lines. Thus
option A is correct. Although yy works similarly, it copies (yanks) text rather
than deleting it, so option B is incorrect. Option C works in many text editors,
but not in vi. Option D works in emacs and similar text editors (including pico
and nano), but not in vi. Option E, or something similar, works in many GUI
text editors, but not in vi, so it is incorrect.

4. True or false: Unicode is useful for encoding most European languages but
not Asian languages.
  False Unicode provides support for most alphabets, including the huge
logographic systems used in common East Asian languages.

5. True or false: GUI text editors for ASCII are superior to text-mode ASCII
text editors because the GUI editors support underlining, italics, and
multiple fonts.
  False Support for underlining, italics, multiple fonts, and similar advanced
formatting features is present in word processors, not plain-text editors—even
GUI text editors lack such support.

6. True or false: If you have never used a text editor before, the nano text
editor is usually the best one to learn first.
  True Due to its ease of use, nano is typically the best editor to learn first.

7. ASCII supports _______ unique characters (not including control
characters).
  128

8. Three keystrokes that can initiate a search-and-replace operation in nano
are F14, _______, and _______.
  Ctrl+\ and Esc+R

9. While in vi’s command mode, you can type _______ to undo a change.
  u

10. To save a file and exit the vi text editor in command mode, type _______.
  ZZ
  
CHAPTER 11

1. After using a text editor to create a shell script, what step should you take
before trying to use the script by typing its name?
  A Scripts, like binary programs, normally have at least one executable bit set,
although they can be run in certain ways without this feature, so option A is
correct. There is no standard /usr/bin/scripts directory, and scripts can
reside in any directory, so option B is incorrect. Scripts are interpreted
programs, which means that they don’t need to be compiled. Typing bash
scriptname will run the script; option C is incorrect. Viruses are extremely rare
in Linux, and because you just created the script, the only ways in which it
could possibly contain a virus would be if your system was already infected or
if you wrote it as a virus. Thus option D is incorrect. Most spell checkers are
intended for English or other human languages, so they lack valid Bash
commands such as esac. Furthermore, even if every keyword is spelled
correctly, the script could contain bugs. Thus option E is incorrect.

2. Describe the effect of the following short script, cp1, if it’s called as cp1
big.c big.cc:
  C The cp command is the only one called in the script, and that command
copies files. Because the script passes the arguments ($1 and $2) to cp in
reverse order, their effect is reversed—whereas cp copies its first argument to
the second name, the cp1 script copies the second argument to the first name.
Option C correctly describes this effect. Option A ignores the reversed order of
the arguments, so this option is incorrect. The cp command has nothing to do
with compiling C or C++ programs, and neither does the script, making option
B incorrect. Since cp is a simple file-copying command, it can’t convert a C
program into a C++ program, making option D incorrect. The script’s first line
is a valid shebang line, contrary to option E, so that option is incorrect.

3. What is the purpose of conditional expressions in shell scripts?
  C Conditional expressions return a true or false response, enabling the script
to execute one set of instructions or another or to terminate or continue a loop.
Option C is another way of saying this, and so it is correct. Conditional
expressions have nothing to do with license conditions (option A), displaying
information on the environment (option B), Pavlovian conditioning (option D),
or executing the script at certain times of day (option E). That said, conditional
expressions could be used in the service of any of these goals, but that’s not
their purpose.

4. True or false: A user types myscript laser.txt to run a script called
myscript. Within myscript, the $0 variable holds the value laser.txt.
  False The $0 variable holds the name of the script—myscript in this example.
To access the first parameter passed to the script (laser.txt), the script must
use the $1 variable.

5. True or false: Valid looping statements in Bash include for, while, and
until.
   True You can use for to execute a loop a fixed number of times, whereas while
and until execute until a test condition is no longer met or is met, respectively.

6. True or false: The following script launches three simultaneous instances
of the terminal program.
  False The effect of the specified script is to launch three instances of terminal
sequentially; the second launches only after the first terminates, and the third
launches only after the second terminates. To do as the question specifies, you
should include a trailing ampersand (&) in at least the first two calls to terminal
(as in terminal &); this causes them to run in the background, so that the script

7. You’ve written a simple shell script that does nothing but launch
programs. In order to ensure that the script works with most user shells,
what should its first line read?
  #!/bin/sh

8. What command can you use to display prompts for a user in a shell script?
  echo

9. What Bash scripting command can you use to control the program flow
based on a variable that can take many values (such as all the letters of the
alphabet)?
  case

10. What Bash scripting command can you use to control the return value
generated by a script, independent of the other commands used in the
script?
  exit
  
CHAPTER 12 

1. What is the purpose of the system account with a UID of 0?

2. What type of information will you find in /etc/passwd for ordinary user
accounts? (Select all that apply.)

3. You want to run the command cat /etc/shadow as root, but you’re logged
in as an ordinary user. Which of the following commands will do the job,
assuming that the system is configured to give you root access via the
appropriate command?

4. True or false: whoami provides more information than id.

5. True or false: Linux stores information on its groups in the /etc/groups
file.

6. True or false: As a general rule, you should employ extra care when
running programs as root.

7. The file that associates usernames with UID numbers in Linux is
_______________. (Provide the complete path to the file.)

8. To learn who is currently logged into the computer and what programs
they’re currently running, you can type _______.

9. UIDs below 500 or 1,000 (depending on the distribution) are reserved for
use by ___________ accounts.

10. A(n) ___________ environment means that a person cannot deny
actions, and the sudo command helps establish this environment.
