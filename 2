He'd bump into it all right for instance 
He lived extremly nice home. 
the chimney pot had come loose in a storm the night before 
Mr Bump went to garden shed to fetch ladder, it weas very long ladder
Crached window in the living room, kitchen, bedroom.
Mr Bunp had many jobs but to somehow they never to last very long as soon as anything got lost or broken, splinted, chipped or snapped, cracked, toe, ring
split, slipped. 
We tripped over the farm dog and split the milk 
got his head stuck in the blue box had two pence the fire brigade come on 
set him free  for instance when mr bump was a carppencer he found that when 
hammering nails hammered his thumb most of the time and the nail have it all 
in order to recover from the series of rather unfortunate happenings 
mr Bump decide to go away for a holiday there he could think about what sort of job he could do where he wouldn't be such a nuisance to everybody 
He went to seaside 
He fell off a boat into the scene and lifeboat had become a rescue 
One day when he was practically walking along the beach man his own busness he
got his food stuck in a bucket as he couldn't get it off he had to hop around with it on his foot for hours and as he hopped along the beach he hopped straight into a large hole that somebody had dug and they had ti stay there all night because he couldn't climb out on his own 
He despite all these little accidents 
He had a splendid idea about what sort of a job he should do it 
Absolutely splendid idea 
He works bobster job is picking apples but he couldn't use a ladder to climb up 
the tree to pick the apples like other apples pickers are older 
he is much better way of picking apples than that 
He just walks about and before long he being walks into a tree 
down falls an apple a he ketch it
